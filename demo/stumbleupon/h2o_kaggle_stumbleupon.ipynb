International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor

Omega It s easy to take for granted just how insanely close some Olympic races are and how much the minutiae of it all can matter The perfect example is the traditional starting gun Seems easy You pull a trigger and the race starts Boom What people don t consider When a conventional gun goes off the sound travels to the ears of the closest runner a fraction of a second sooner than the others That s just enough to matter and why the latest starting pistol has traded in the mechanical boom for orchestrated electronic noise Omega has been the watch company tasked as the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games since 1932 At the 2010 Vancouver games they debuted their new starting gun which is a far cry from the iconic revolvers associated with early games it s clearly electronic but still more than a button that s pressed to get the show rolling About as far away as you can get probably while still clearly being a starting gun Pull the trigger once and off the Olympians go If it s pressed twice consecutively it signals a false start Working through a speaker system is what eliminates any kind of advantage for athletes It s not a big advantage being close to a gun but the sound of the bullet traveling one meter every three milliseconds could contribute to a win Powder pistols have been connected to a speaker system before but even then runners could react to the sound of the real pistol firing rather than wait for the speaker sounds to reach them This year s setup will have speakers placed equidistant from runners forcing the sound to reach each competitor at exactly the same time It wouldn t be an enormous difference Omega Timing board member Peter H\\u00fcrzeler said in an email but when you think about reaction times being measured in tiny fractions of a second placing a speaker behind each lane has eliminated any sort of advantage for any athlete They all hear the start commands and signal at exactly the same moment There s also an ulterior reason for its look In a post September 11th world a gun on its way to a major event is going to raise more than a few TSA eyebrows even if it s a realistic looking fake Rather than deal with that the e gun can be transported while still maintaining the general look of a starting gun But there s still nothing like hearing a starting gun go off at the start of a race more than signaling the runners there s probably some Pavlovian response after more than a century of Olympic games that make people want to hear the real thing not a whiny electronic noise Everyone in the stands at home thankfully will still be getting that The sound is programmable and can be synthesized to sound like almost anything H\\u00fcrzeler says but we program it to sound like a pistol it s a way to use the best possible starting technology but to keep a rich tradition alive and that can be carried on a plane without the hassle, too technology,gadgets,london 2012,london olympics,olympics,omega,starting guns,summer

fall asleep I was easily awaken and I simply wasn t getting enough of rest at night I didn t want to take medication and this led me to learn several tips and tricks that really helped me to overcome my insomnia Some of these tips I try to follow regularly Don t worry about not getting enough sleep Try not to worry about how much you sleep Such worrying can start a cycle of negative thoughts that contribute to a condition known as learned insomnia Learned insomnia occurs when you worry so much about whether or not you will be able to get adequate sleep that the bedtime rituals and behavior actually trigger insomnia Don t force yourself to sleep The very attempt of trying to do so actually awakes you making it more difficult to sleep Go to bed only when you are feeling really tired and sleepy Don t look at the alarm clock at night Looking at the clock promotes increased anxiety and obsession about time Body heating procedures Some studies suggest that soaking in hot water before going to bed can ease the transition into a deeper sleep Avoid oversleep Don t oversleep to make up for a poor night s sleep Doing so for even a couple of days can reset your body clock and make it harder for you to sleep at night Sex Sex is a well known nighttime stress reliever Healthy sex life enhances your relationship relaxes your body releases happy chemicals and even promotes wellness And it welcomes sleep Avoid alcohol as a sleeping aid Avoid the use of alcohol in the late evening The most common myth found among people is that they believe alcohol helps in the sleep But the fact is alcohol may initially act as sedative but it produces a number of sleep impairing effects in the long run Associate your bed and bedroom with sleep and sex only Don t watch TV eat or read in bed Although these things help some people sleep they can also give your brain the idea that bed isn t just for sleeping and this can keep you awake Naps If you suffer from insomnia try not taking a nap If the goal is to sleep more during the night napping may steal hours desired later on If you re a regular napper and experiencing difficulty falling or staying asleep at night give up the nap and see

simplex virus HSV 1 the most common type usually appears as cold sores on the mouth and lips whereas HSV 2 affects the genitals buttocks and rectum Patient s have reported that symptoms can appear five days after coming into contact with the virus on the other hand it may be months or even years until the first outbreak Unfortunately once you have caught the genital herpes virus there is no cure for it You can prevent the virus spreading and manage pain caused by the blisters with a course of anti viral treatment Should I have sex if I have genital herpes When you have symptoms of genital herpes HSV is very contagious when blisters are present and there is a high chance of passing on the virus if you have sex You should not have sex from the time symptoms first start until they are fully over If you do have sex using a condom may not fully protect against passing on the virus as the condom only protects the area that is covered When you do not have symptoms which is most of the time It is less likely that you will pass the virus on when you have sex However some virus will be present on the genital skin surface from time to time although infrequently So there is still a small chance that you may pass on the virus when you have sex when you do not have symptoms People who take antiviral medication long term to prevent recurrences have a reduced risk of passing on the virus What is aciclovir it is an antiviral tablet which aims to reduce the severity and duration of an outbreak of genital herpes How do I take the medicine One tablet three times a day for five days Start taking it as soon as you feel a herpes outbreak beginning What are the potential side effects Like any medication these include nausea vomiting diarrhoea or an allergic rash can occur Should this occur you should stop this medication immediately and contact us via your secure online patient record How effective is this treatment Should be effective in most patients if taken as soon as the signs of an outbreak occur How long will one course of treatment last One course is sufficient for a single outbreak genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (hsv), and is transmitted through unprotected and oral sex. anyone who is sexually active can catch genital herpes and if the genital herpes is left untreated it may spread to other parts of the

insidershealth.com&quot;,&quot;body&quot;:&quot;Racing For Recovery is the growing idea that drug addiction and alcoholism can be cured by focusing one s energies towards something positive Eddie Freas tell CNN that I feel better when I m working out It does wonders for the mind The reason I started running it was a switch that went off in my head I started feeling positive and feeling great about myself It is true that dopamine levels can be increased by strenuous physical activity but is simply getting your fix in a healthy way actually healthy for you in the long run Freas admits to trying Alcoholics Anonymous and rehab but says the institutions did nothing to cure his drug addiction perhaps that is because of AA s non belief in the ability of a true addict to get cured they look at it as a disease that like cancer can only go into remission In any case Freas is sober today and has gotten there by doing something he loves that much is commendable Whether or not this strategy will better his quality of life or keep him sober over time has yet to be seen The trick apparently isn t just to exercise but to find something anything that will help This Content is restricted to

brownies It seems that I can t get through one full week without trying a new brownie combination Just wait until you see the next one I am going to experiment with These are super simple I used my go to brownie recipe and just added a few Oreos You could even do the same with boxed brownies Just make the frosting and add some more cookies I only frosted a few because I just don t love frosting on brownies Mr How Sweet really enjoyed the frosted ones If you waste a good 3 4 of your day on Twitter like I do you will know that last night Mr How Sweet brought me home a dozen hot pink roses I didn t make him dinner my half unpacked mess is strewn in 4 different rooms and I was in holey sweat pants once he got home Oh yes and I was half asleep while he professed his undying love to me And I just continued to lay there Sounds eerily similar to the night he proposed Good thing there were brownies on the counter As my dad says marriage is rarely 50 50 The cookies somewhat melted into the batter once baked but if you look closely you can see some cookies inside the brownies That is the best part The frosting is the same frosting I used for the cookies and cream cupcakes It is creamy delicious and looks like ice cream Can t beat that I think out of all the brownies I have made in the past few months these ones may be the best I love the texture Chewy gooey brownies crunchy cookies Cookies and Cream Brownies 2 3 squares baking chocolate 1 2 lb butter 2 cups sugar 4 eggs 1 cup flour 1 teaspoon vanilla 8 Oreo cookies crumbled Preheat oven to 350 Melt butter and baking sqaures in a microwave safe bowl In the mixing bowl cream melted butter and chocolate mixture Add in sugar and vanilla and beat until fluffy about 2 3 minutes Add in eggs beating one at a time Add flour and stir just until combined Fold in cookie crumbles Pour into greased 9 x 13 baking dish I used a 8 x 8 square cake pan Bake for 35 45 minutes or until just barely done Cool before frosting I changed this recipe slightly from my other brownie posts so if you have recently tried it try adding 2 more eggs Cookies and Cream Frosting 2 sticks butter softened 1 1 2 2 lbs powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 2 tablespoons milk 10 Oreo cookies Mix butter and powdered sugar together adding sugar gradually to the mix Add vanilla Mix in milk adding more if needed Continue to add milk and sugar until it reaches the desired consistency Crush Oreos and fold them into the frosting I don t think these brownies will last another evening in our house Ha who am I kidding They may not even last until Mr How Sweet gets home Now I need to find some spectacular recipe to make for dinner tonight And remind Mr How Sweet that he married someone 10 years younger not an old granny Tags brownies chocolate recipes
