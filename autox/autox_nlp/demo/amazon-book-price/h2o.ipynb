      "Few novelists have conveyed the subtleties and nuances of their own social milieu with the wit and insight of Jane Austen. Here in one volume are her seven great novels: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, and Lady Susan. Through her vivacious and spirited heroines and their circle, Austen vividly portrays English middle-class life as the eighteenth century came to a close and the nineteenth century began. Each of the novels is a love story and a story about marriage—marriage for love, for financial security, for social status. But they are not romances; ironic, comic, and wise, they are masterly evocations of the society Jane Austen observed. This beautiful volume covers the literary career of one of England’s finest prose stylists of any century.\n",

The most entertaining and comprehensive book on cricket in this country to be published yet, it tells the story of the nine great waves that have rolled through the history of Indian cricket, from India’s international debut in 1932 to the incredible achievements of viral Kohli’s team today. Each wave or era was chock-full of mesmerizing stars, thrilling moments, great victories, heart-breaking losses and significant turning points—this book tells the story of each of them in great detail. The first wave of Indian cricket rolled in against the background of momentous changes in the country and the world: Gandhi’s Civil disobedience campaign, world War II and India becoming independent. Through each of the successive waves, India strengthened its position in the Cricketing firmament. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became the most powerful nation in world cricket—the prowess of the National team today matches the economic strength of the Cricketing establishment. As a five-year-old, the author saw Vijay Hazare, India’s first test-winning Captain, play. Since then he has been witness to some of the most dramatic moments of Indian cricket: India’s first win in England in 1971, Kapil Dev lifting the world Cup in 1983 at Lord’s, Tendulkar’s first test century at old trafford in 1990, Sunil Gavaskar scoring his 30th test century, the 2011 World Cup in India where M. S. Dhoni emulated Kapil Dev, Virat Kohli in 2018 in England proving he is the best batsman in the world today and much more. He brings to the book his first-hand experience of some of the most seminal moments in Indian cricket, his Encyclopaedic knowledge of the game and his unrivalled ability as a chronicler of the sport to create a magisterial history of Indian cricket. Once dismissed by the English as the dull dogs of cricket, India is now eagerly courted by all Cricketing nations. On the field its cricketers are displaying skills which make India a world-beater. Over a billion Indians, the greatest fan base in the world, treat their cricketers as demigods. The nine waves is a fitting testimonial to the game’s only superpower.\".\", \"\"A man who has attained mastery of an art reveals it in his every action.\"--Samurai Maximum.\n",

While other athletes are earning fortunes in salaries and-or endorsements, the oarsmen gain fame only with each other and strive without any hope of financial reward.\n",

What have they sacrificed, and what inner demons have they appeased? In answering these questions, David Halberstam takes as his focus the 1984 single sculls trials in Princeton. The man who wins will gain the right to represent the United States in the 84 Olympiad; the losers will then have to struggle further to gain a place in the two- or four-man boats. And even if they succeed, they will have to live with the bitter knowledge that they were not the best, only close to it.\n",

This book series includes the books: 'The Immortals of Meluha’, 'The Secret of the Nagas’ and 'The Oath of the Vayuputras’. This book collection is published by Westland Publications\n",
      "The first book in the trilogy is 'The Immortals of Meluha’ which introduces readers to the character of Shiva. Although Shiva is considered to be a god according to the Hindu mythology, this book tries to fit him as a historical character. The book describes Shiva as a very strong, courageous and powerful warrior from the land of Tibet and is the chief of the tribe Gunas. The current rulers are Suryavanshi who are in constant war with Chandravanshis. He is asked by the Daksha, the king of Meluha which is an empire created by Lord Ram to help him in their fight against Chandravanshis. Shiva joins the side only to realize later that he may have made the wrong choice. The second novel 'The Secret of the Nagas’ reveals the truth of the Naga tribes and this is where the story takes a turn and Shiva realizes that he is on the wrong road. The last and the final book of the series, 'The Oath of the Vayuputras’ provides the ideal end to this saga with a stunning climax that showcases the might and courage of Shiva.\n",
