How to contribute
=================

We want AutoX to become a leading international AutoML solution. To achieve this goal, we need your help!

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

If you want to help, just create a pull request on our github page. To the new user, working with Git can sometimes be
confusing and frustrating. If you are not familiar with Git you can also contact us by :ref:`email <authors>`.

We are looking forward to hear from you! =)
